# Presentation
  Colla-Config tool is a Node.js open source project implementing a new collaborative product line configuration approach (Colla-Config), that relies on free order configuration process. Each stakeholder freely expresses his/her configuration decisions towards the desired product without being constrained by the configuration decisions made by the other ones. The conflict resolution strategy is preference-based. It is based on (1) stakeholders' preferences elicitation under the form of substitution rules to be considered if one or more of their configuration decisions could not be retained in case of conflict, and (2) computation of Minimal Correction Subsets allowing to resolve all conflicts while fairely taking into account all stakeholders preferences.
  For more information please refer to the research papers about Colla-Config.
